    "### Setting-up the Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda allows us to create isolated environments for our projects, each with its own dependencies. This is essential for managing packages and avoiding conflicts. A Conda virtual environment is a self-contained directory that holds a **specific collection** of packages and their dependencies. It allows us to create isolated environments for different projects, each with its own set of libraries, versions, and dependencies. This is particularly useful for managing the complexity of software development, ensuring that our projects don't interfere with each other and avoiding conflicts between package versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Conda Virtual Environments?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"llm problem\" src=\"assets/environment.png\" width=\"70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Isolation:** Each virtual environment is isolated from your system's global environment and other virtual environments. This means you can have different versions of packages installed for different projects without conflicts.\n",
    "- **Dependency Management:** Conda handles package dependencies automatically. When you install a package in a virtual environment, Conda ensures that all necessary dependencies are also installed.\n",
    "- **Portability:** Virtual environments can be easily shared with others. By sharing the environment configuration (in a `requirements.txt` file, for instance), collaborators can replicate the same environment on their systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To setting-up the virtual environment you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **1. Open Anaconda Prompt** (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux): Launch the Anaconda Prompt or Terminal, which provides a command-line interface for executing Conda-related commands.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **2. Create a Virtual Environment**: In the Anaconda Prompt or Terminal, use the following command to create a new virtual environment named `llm_env` (you can replace `llm_env` with your desired environment name):\n",
    "> \n",
    "> <div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    ">   <code>conda create --name llm_env python=3.10</code>\n",
    "> </div> \n",
    "> \n",
    "> **3. Activate the Environment:** Activate the Virtual Environment: Once the virtual environment is created, activate it using the following command:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> <div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    ">   <code>conda activate llm_env</code>\n",
    "> </div> \n",
    "> \n",
    "> **4. Install Dependencies** from `requirements.txt`: If you have a `requirements.txt` file that contains a list of dependencies, you can install them into your virtual environment using the following command:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> <div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    ">   <code>pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "> </code>\n",
    "> </div> \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Make sure the `requirements.txt` file is present in the directory where you are executing the command. This command will install all the dependencies specified in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **5. Launch Visual Studio Code**: After installing the dependencies, you can launch Jupyter Notebook by executing the following command in the Anaconda Prompt or Terminal: \n",
    "> \n",
    "> <div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    ">   <code>jupyter notebook\n",
    "> </code>\n",
    "> </div> \n",
    "> \n",
    ">> or you can use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by open the folder directory.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **6. Open a Jupyter Notebook File**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`*.ipynb`) you want to work on.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **7. Select the Kernel**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> At the top-right corner of the notebook editor, you'll see a dropdown menu labeled **\"Kernel\"**. Click on it to select a kernel.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> **8. Choose the Virtual Environment**\n",
    "> \n",
    "> From the dropdown list, you should see a list of available kernels, including those from your virtual environments. Look for \"`llm_dev`\" in the list. If you don't see it, make sure you've installed the required packages and set up the virtual environment correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"llm problem\" src=\"assets/conda_env.png\" width=\"70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you'll be able to connect to the kernel of the \"`llm_dev`\" virtual environment in Visual Studio Code's Jupyter Notebook. This ensures that the notebook runs within the isolated environment, allowing you to utilize the packages and configurations specific to that environment.\n"

    "A library in programming is a collection of pre-written code, functions, classes, and tools that you can use to perform various tasks without having to write everything from scratch. Libraries provide solutions to common problems and allow you to leverage the expertise of other developers. They can save you time and effort, increase the reliability of your code, and enable you to focus on the unique aspects of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries come in various forms, from general-purpose libraries that provide fundamental programming capabilities to domain-specific libraries tailored for specific tasks, such as data analysis, web development, machine learning, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modules**\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a single file containing Python code that groups related functions, classes, and variables together. Modules provide a way to organize code, making it more modular, reusable, and maintainable. By breaking your code into modules, you can focus on specific functionalities and keep your codebase organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's modular architecture allows you to create your own modules and use them as building blocks in larger projects. Additionally, Python comes with a rich set of built-in modules (part of the Python Standard Library) that cover a wide range of tasks, from file I/O to math operations.\n",

    "In conclusion, this section provided an introduction to Python environment. Additionally, we covered the basics of Python programming for language preprocessing, including variables, data types, operations, and control structures. We delved into the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and discussed word embeddings, major text libraries in Python (such as NLTK and spaCy), and the importance of text preprocessing and tokenization. Through demonstrations and examples, we gained practical insights into utilizing these libraries for simple text processing tasks. By building a solid foundation in these areas, participants will be well-equipped to delve further into the fascinating world of Generative AI and LLMs."
