    "\n",
    "We have created a GPT question and answering system using Large Language Models (LLMs) that can generate answers based on our data. Now, let's delve deeper into how LLMs understand natural language by exploring the concept of embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), **embeddings** are representations of **words or text as numerical vectors**. These vectors capture the **semantic and contextual** information of the text, allowing the model to understand the meaning and relationships between words. In simpler terms, embeddings help the chatbot understand the meaning of words and how they relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a chatbot designed to assist customers with their inquiries. When a customer asks a question, the chatbot needs to understand the meaning of the question and provide a relevant answer. This is where embeddings come into play. The chatbot is trained on a large amount of text data and learns to associate words with their respective embeddings. These embeddings encode the information about the words' meaning and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a customer asks, \"What are the payment options available?\" the chatbot uses the embeddings to understand the meaning of the words \"payment\" and \"options\" and their relationship within the sentence. It can then provide an appropriate response by retrieving information from its knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings enable the chatbot to **make sense** of the customer's input and generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. By capturing the meaning and relationships between words, embeddings enhance the chatbot's understanding of natural language and improve its ability to generate meaningful and coherent answers."

    "\n",
    "A vector (or embedding) is an **array of numbers**. That on its own is exciting, but what is even more exciting is that these arrays can represent more complex data like text, images, audio or even video. In the case of text, these representations are designed to capture **semantic and syntactic** relationships between words, allowing algorithms to understand and process language more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings, specifically, are dense vector representations that encode the meaning of a word based on its context in a large corpus of text. In simpler terms, they map words to numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space, where similar words are located closer to each other. This is done in a vector database (we will talk about this later)\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating these embeddings is done by an embedding model. There are multiple embedding models that can be used. OpenAI also provide embedding model but we will use free LLM model so we don't ran out of credit. We will use **`\"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\"`** embedding model.\n",

relations  among  state  that  is mutually beneficial.\\n\\nWe all understand the negative impacts of the pandemic are tremendous  both on health   and the social economy.\\n\\nWe  are  also  aware that  the  virus  knows  no  boundaries across nations \\n\\nNo one is safe until everyone is \\n\\nIf  division  and  rivalries  continue  to persist   then  I  am concerned that the pillars of stability and sustainable peace will crumble  or even destroyed.\\n\\nA  world  of peace stable and prosperous becomes  more and more difficult to attain.\\n\\nExcellencies,\\n\\nThis year, Indonesia also celebrates the 75th anniversary of its independence.\\n\\nIt  has  always  been  our  commitment   Indonesia  will continuously contribute to world peace as mandated by our constitution.\\n\\nIndonesia  will  continue  to  play  a  role  as  bridgebuilder  as part of the solution \\n\\nConsistently, this  commitment  is  continuously  upheld  including  throughout  Indonesia’s  membership  at  the  UN Security Council.\\n\\nThe  spirit of  cooperation  will  continue  to  be  promoted  by Indonesia   the spirit which provides mutual benefits to all parties and leave no country behind.\\n\\nNo one no country should be left behind.\\n\\nThe  respect  for  equality   was  also  emphasized  by Indonesia’s  founding  father   Soekarno   Bung  Karno during the Asia-Africa Conference in Bandung in 1955  that gave birth to the Bandung Principles.\\n\\nUntil now the Bandung  Principles  are  still  relevant including  in  peaceful  settlement  of  disputes... promotion  of cooperation  and respect for international law.\\n\\nPalestine  becomes  the  only  country   attending  the Bandung Conference that until present has not enjoyed its independence.\\n\\nIndonesia consistently supports Palestine... to gain its rights.\\n\\nIn  our  region,  along  with  other ASEAN  member  countries, Indonesia  continues  to  maintain  South  East  Asia   as  a peaceful, stable, and prosperous region.\\n\\nOn  its  53rd anniversary  on 8th of August 2020,  ASEAN reaffirmed its commitment to continue maintaining peace and stability in the region.\\n\\nThe same spirit of cooperation and peace was put forward by Indonesia  to  a  wider  region   the  Indo-Pacific region through the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific.\\n\\nExcellencies,\\n\\nAgainst  this  current global situation allow  me  to  convey  a few thoughts.\\n\\nFirst  the  UN  should  continue  to  improve  itself  through reforms, revitalization and efficiency.\\n\\nThe  UN  needs  to  prove  that  multilateralism delivers especially during the time of crisis...\\n\\nThe UN  needs  to  be  more  responsive  and  effective  in tackling global challenges.\\n\\nAnd all of us bear the responsibility to further strengthen the UN \\n\\nSo  that  the  UN  remains  relevant  and contributive   in keeping with the challenges of time.\\n\\nThe  UN  is  not a  mere building  in the  city  of New  York... rather it  represents an ideal and shared commitment  of  all nations  to realize world peace and prosperity for our future generations.\\n\\nIndonesia has an unwavering faith in the United Nations and multilateralism.\\n\\nMultilateralism is the only way that could guarantee equality.\\n\\nSecond   collective  global  leadership  has  to  be strengthened.\\n\\nWe are all aware that when  it  comes  to relations  among countries  in international relations  every country always protects their national interests.\\n\\nHowever, we  must  not forget     that  all  of  us  have  the responsibility  to  contribute  to  be  part  of  the  solution for peace, stability, and prosperity of the world..\\n\\nThis is  where  the  UN  should  play a role  to  strengthen collective global leadership.\\n\\nThe  world  needs the spirit  of  collaboration  and a stronger global leadership  to create a better world.\\n\\nThird,  cooperation  in  tackling  COVID-19  must  be strengthened in terms of the health aspects as well as the socio-economic effects \\n\\nVaccine  will  be  the  game  changer  in  the  war  against pandemic.\\n\\nWe need to work together to ensure  that all countries have equal access to a safe vaccine with affordable price...\\n\\nIn the long term the management of resilient global health system needs to be further improved.\\n\\nThe resilience of global health system.... which is based on the  national  health  resilience will  determine  the  future  of our world.\\n\\nFrom the economic perspective . revitalization of economic activities gradually needs to start  by tackling the limits of our global supply chain today.\\n\\nRevitalization of economy must  prioritize  the  health  of  all citizens of the world \\n\\nA  healthy  world A  productive  world needs  to  be  our priority.\\n\\nAll of these will only be achieved if all of us continue.. to work together work together and work together.\\n\\nLet us solidify our commitment and consistently carry out our commitment to work together.\\n\\nThat is all from me.\\n\\nI thank you.\"',

When I asked Lee if this was risky, he admitted it was but insisted that Tellus utilized “very strict underwriting criteria” and had not yet seen any defaults “because the majority of its borrowers go on to soon refinance their loans at more favorable terms.” Well, last week U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown, chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, wrote a letter to FDIC chairman Martin Gruenberg expressing concerns about Tellus’s claims.
