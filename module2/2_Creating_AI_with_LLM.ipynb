By leveraging machine learning algorithms, generative AI models can generate new content that resembles the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Learning \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is a specialized branch of machine learning that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning models, known as artificial neural networks, are designed to learn hierarchical representations of data through multiple layers of interconnected nodes, called neurons. Each layer of neurons learns increasingly complex and abstract features from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning has significantly advanced generative AI by **enabling the development of complex and sophisticated models capable of generating high-quality content**. Deep learning models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown remarkable abilities in generating realistic images, coherent text, and even human-like speech.\n",

    "The Transformer is a type of deep learning architecture that has revolutionized the field of natural language processing. It was introduced in the paper [\"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). The Transformer model employs self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between words in a sentence, enabling it to learn contextual relationships and generate coherent and contextually relevant text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture excels at handling text data which is inherently sequential. They take a text sequence as input and produce another text sequence as output. eg. to translate an input French sentence to English.\n",

The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a representation, which is then passed to the decoder. The decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation and previous outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pre-training and fine-tuning are two key steps in the training process of language models, including Large Language Models (LLMs). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-training**: In the pre-training phase, a language model is trained on a large corpus of unlabeled text data. During this phase, the model learns to predict missing words in sentences based on the surrounding context. It develops an understanding of language patterns, grammar, and contextual relationships. The pre-training process typically involves techniques like masked language modeling, where certain words are randomly masked and the model learns to predict them based on the remaining context.\n",

    "**Fine-tuning**: After pre-training, the language model is fine-tuned on specific labeled datasets for specific downstream tasks. Fine-tuning involves training the pre-trained model on labeled data related to a particular task, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, or text classification. This process allows the model to adapt to the specific task by learning task-specific patterns and improving its performance. Fine-tuning is performed on a smaller dataset, which is typically task-specific and labeled by human experts.\n",

    "## Introduction to LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models that refers to the integration of multiple language models and APIs to create a powerful and flexible language processing pipeline. It involves connecting different language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-2, with other tools and APIs to enhance their functionality and address specific business needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LangChain concept aims to leverage the strengths of each language model and API to create a comprehensive language processing system. It allows developers to combine different models for tasks like question answering, text generation, translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of the library is that we can **“chain”**“ together different components to create more advanced use cases around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prompt templates**: Prompt templates are templates for different types of prompts. Like “chatbot” style templates, ELI5 question-answering, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **LLMs**: Large language models like GPT-3, BLOOM, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Agents**: Agents use LLMs to decide what actions should be taken. Tools like web search or calculators can be used, and all are packaged into a logical loop of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory**: Short-term memory, long-term memory.\n",

    "### Environment Set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we'll use OpenAI's model APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting API key and `.env`\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. When setting up an API key and using a .env file in your Python project, you follow these general steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain an API key**: If you're working with an external API or service that requires an API key, you need to obtain one from the provider. This usually involves signing up for an account and generating an API key specific to your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a .env file**: In your project directory, create a new file and name it \".env\". This file will store your API key and other sensitive information securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Store API key in .env**: Open the .env file in a text editor and add a line to store your API key. The format should be `API_KEY=your_api_key`, where \"API_KEY\" is the name of the variable and \"your_api_key\" is the actual value of your API key. Make sure not to include any quotes or spaces around the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Load environment variables**: In your Python code, you need to load the environment variables from the .env file before accessing them. Import the dotenv module and add the following code at the beginning of your script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load environment variables from .env file\n",
    "load_dotenv()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> `dotenv` library is a popular Python library that simplifies the process of loading environment variables from a .env file into your Python application. It allows you to store configuration variables separately from your code, making it easier to manage sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or other environment-specific settings.\n"

    "In this module, we explored various aspects of working with large language models (LLMs) and building question-answering systems. We started by understanding the architecture and key concepts of large language models, including the Transformer model and the process of pre-training and fine-tuning. We also introduced popular LLMs like GPT-3, GPT-2, and BERT, discussing their capabilities and limitations. We then delved into the LangChain concept, which allows us to connect databases and text data with LLMs for question answering. We demonstrated the use of OpenAI and LangChain to build question-answering systems with both databases and text data. Additionally, we explored text generation using HuggingFace's models, covering the setup and integration of the HuggingFace Hub. Overall, this module provided insights into harnessing the power of large language models for question answering and text generation tasks."
