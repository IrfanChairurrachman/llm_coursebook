    "**What is Large Language Models?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) is an advanced type of language model that represent a breakthrough in the field of natural language processing (NLP). These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text by leveraging the power of deep learning algorithms and massive amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've ever chatted with a virtual assistant or interacted with an AI customer service agent, you might have interacted with a large language model without even realizing it. These models have a wide range of applications, from chatbots to language translation to content creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most impressive large language models are developed by OpenAI. Their GPT-3 model, for example, has over [175 billion parameters](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/GPT-3#:~:text=GPT%2D3%20has%20more%20than,(BERT)%20and%20Turing%20NLG.) and is able to perform tasks like [summarization](https://wandb.ai/mostafaibrahim17/ml-articles/reports/Compressing-the-Story-The-Magic-of-Text-Summarization--VmlldzozNTYxMjc2), [question-answering](https://wandb.ai/mostafaibrahim17/ml-articles/reports/The-Answer-Key-Unlocking-the-Potential-of-Question-Answering-With-NLP--VmlldzozNTcxMDE3), and even creative writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**How a Large Language Model was Built?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of LLMs is based on the Transformer model, which has revolutionized NLP tasks. The Transformer model utilizes a self-attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence, capturing dependencies and relationships between words more effectively. This architecture enables LLMs to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses, making them valuable tools for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large-scale transformer model known as a “large language model” is typically too massive to run on a single computer and is, therefore, provided as a service over an API or web interface. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data from sources such as books, articles, websites, and numerous other forms of written content. By analyzing the statistical relationships between words, phrases, and sentences through this training process, the models can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to prompts or queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "*ChatGPT’s GPT-3* model, for instance, was trained on massive amounts of internet text data, giving it the ability to understand various languages and possess knowledge of diverse topics. As a result, it can produce text in multiple styles. While its capabilities may seem impressive, including translation, text summarization, and question-answering, they are not surprising, given that these functions operate using special “grammars” that match up with prompts."

    "### Understanding what is Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer is a type of deep learning architecture that has revolutionized the field of natural language processing. It was introduced in the paper [\"Attention Is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). The Transformer model employs self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies between words in a sentence, enabling it to learn contextual relationships and generate coherent and contextually relevant text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture excels at handling text data which is inherently sequential. They take a text sequence as input and produce another text sequence as output. eg. to translate an input French sentence to English.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/the_transformer_3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture consists of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a representation, which is then passed to the decoder. The decoder generates the output sequence based on the encoder's representation and previous outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/The_transformer_encoders_decoders.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key components and concepts of the Transformer architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Positional Encoding**: Transformers incorporate positional encoding to provide the model with information about the order of words in the input sequence. Positional encoding is usually added to the input embeddings and allows the model to differentiate between the positions of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "![positional_encoding](assets/positional_encoding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Self-attention allows each word in the input sequence to attend to all other words. It computes the attention weight between each pair of words and uses them to generate a weighted sum of the word embeddings. This mechanism enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and learn contextual relationships effectively.\n",

    "### Pre-training and Fine-tuning of Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-training and fine-tuning are two key steps in the training process of language models, including Large Language Models (LLMs). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-training**: In the pre-training phase, a language model is trained on a large corpus of unlabeled text data. During this phase, the model learns to predict missing words in sentences based on the surrounding context. It develops an understanding of language patterns, grammar, and contextual relationships. The pre-training process typically involves techniques like masked language modeling, where certain words are randomly masked and the model learns to predict them based on the remaining context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning**: After pre-training, the language model is fine-tuned on specific labeled datasets for specific downstream tasks. Fine-tuning involves training the pre-trained model on labeled data related to a particular task, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, or text classification. This process allows the model to adapt to the specific task by learning task-specific patterns and improving its performance. Fine-tuning is performed on a smaller dataset, which is typically task-specific and labeled by human experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), the terms \"pre-trained\" and \"fine-tuned\" refer to two stages in the model development process. This two-step process offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pre-training on large-scale data helps LLMs learn from a diverse range of linguistic patterns and structures, enhancing their language understanding capabilities.\n",
    "- Fine-tuning allows LLMs to adapt to specific tasks or domains, improving their performance and making them more efficient in generating desired outputs.\n",
    "- Fine-tuning requires comparatively less labeled data than training from scratch, making it a practical approach when labeled data is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs, such as GPT-3, GPT-2, and BERT, are examples of large-scale language models that have undergone extensive pre-training and fine-tuning processes. They have been trained on vast amounts of text data and have a large number of parameters. This pre-training and fine-tuning approach allows LLMs to capture complex language patterns, generate coherent text, and perform well on a wide range of natural language processing tasks."

    "### Environment Set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LangChain will usually require integrations with one or more model providers, data stores, APIs, etc. For this example, we'll use OpenAI's model APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting API key and `.env`\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing the API requires an API key, which you can get by creating an account and heading here. When setting up an API key and using a .env file in your Python project, you follow these general steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Obtain an API key**: If you're working with an external API or service that requires an API key, you need to obtain one from the provider. This usually involves signing up for an account and generating an API key specific to your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a .env file**: In your project directory, create a new file and name it \".env\". This file will store your API key and other sensitive information securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Store API key in .env**: Open the .env file in a text editor and add a line to store your API key. The format should be `API_KEY=your_api_key`, where \"API_KEY\" is the name of the variable and \"your_api_key\" is the actual value of your API key. Make sure not to include any quotes or spaces around the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Load environment variables**: In your Python code, you need to load the environment variables from the .env file before accessing them. Import the dotenv module and add the following code at the beginning of your script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load environment variables from .env file\n",
    "load_dotenv()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: `dotenv` library is a popular Python library that simplifies the process of loading environment variables from a .env file into your Python application. It allows you to store configuration variables separately from your code, making it easier to manage sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or other environment-specific settings.\n"
